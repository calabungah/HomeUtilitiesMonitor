            <p>Home Utilities Monitor is a device that is integrated into a home's utilities installations 
                (water, electric, possibly gas) that is paired with a mobile application that will monitor 
                all usage of the utilities and provide feedback directly to a user's mobile device. This is
                to ensure maximum transparency for users and equip them with the insight into their habits 
                and ability to be more knowledgeable about how they use the everyday tools around them. Instead
                 of receiving a bill and taking your provider's word for your usage, Home Utilities Monitor 
                 gives you specific data and can even keep track of things like your vampire electricity i.e. 
                 everything that's plugged in even while it's not being used. Our goal with this project is to 
                 not just simulate an innovation on a small scale, but deliver a fully working product at a low 
                 cost that could be brought to a bigger market one day. Even if that doesnâ€™t happen then we want 
                 to gain valuable project experience that can enhance our portfolios and prepare us for professional 
                 life outside of college.</p>
